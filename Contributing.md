# Area of contribution

A lot of contributions can be made to Lumol, and most of them do not involve
writing code:

- Improving the documentation and the usage of English language;
- Testing the code on your systems to find bugs;
- Providing feedback on the interface;
- Adding new potentials;
- Adding new simulation algorithm;

All these contributions are very welcome. I accept contributions either via
Github pull request (have a look
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for Github model
of pull request); or you can send me patches by email at luthaf@luthaf.fr.

If you want to pick something easy to get started with code, have a look at the
[Level:Easy](https://github.com/Luthaf/cymbalum/labels/L%3AEasy) issues.

If you want to add a new feature to Lumol, please create an issue so that we
can discuss it, and you have more chances to see your changes incorporated.
