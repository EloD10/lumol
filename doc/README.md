# Cymbalum user manual

This directory contains the user manual for the Cymbalum molecular simulation
engine. In order to build it, you will need to have the
[mdbook](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook) program.

You can build the HTML version of the book by running the `mdbook build`
command. Then, point your favorite web browser to `book/index.html` to read the
book.
